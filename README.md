# Wall Jump

![Minecraft version](https://img.shields.io/badge/minecraft-1.8-69C12E.svg)

The original Minecraft Wall Jump mod that allows you to rebound off of walls, like in many other games. You can configure either a limited or unlimited amount of jumps and the key to activate the extra jumps.

Wall Jump was one of my earliest mods, first released for Minecraft 1.5.1 in 2013 and supported until Minecraft 1.8 in 2015. The project, which originally was not on GitHub, is archived here.
